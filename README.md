Optimized for prototyping and small side projects where simplicity and ease of development are important to keep them fun, and the problems solved by complex toolchains ‚Äì automated testing, enforcing code style, highly optimized production code, etc. ‚Äì aren't as big of a concern.

Unbuild lets you enjoy many of the conveniences of modern SPA development with (almost) none of the complexity:

- ‚úåÔ∏è [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and ‚öõÔ∏è [Preact](https://preactjs.com) support with JSX-like syntax thanks to [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm)
- üöÄ Works with any static file server, no `npm` or build process required
- üì¶ Import external ESM and CSS dependencies from CDNs via [Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps)
- üß© Supports [CSS modules](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-the-native-ones/) and [JSON modules](https://css-tricks.com/ecmascript-proposal-json-modules/) through [`es-module-shims`](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims)
- üåç Use The Platform‚Ñ¢ - relies on established or polyfillable standards

## Getting started

The easiest way to start a new project is to fetch the template folder using [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```sh
mkdir app-name
cd app-name
npx degit https://github.com/andreasphil/unbuild/template-vue # or template-preact
```

You'll need a HTTP server for serving the project during development, since features such as JavaScript modules are not supported by the file protocol. Any server will do, though you might want one that routes any non-file request to `index.html` if you use a router such as [`preact-iso`](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/tree/main/packages/preact-iso) or [`vue-router`](https://router.vuejs.org). I like [`servor`](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor):

```sh
# --browse launches a browser, --reload reloads when files change
npx servor --browse --reload
```

## Development workflow

- **Editor:** I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), because it has features such as linting and formatting included out of the box. The [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) extension additionally provides highlighting for htm blocks. I also prefer the [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension to the default formatter.

- **Dependencies:** The most convenient way to use external dependencies is to link them in the `<script type="importmap">` in `index.html` from a CDN such as [unpkg](https://unpkg.com), [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev), [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com), or [esm.sh](https://esm.sh). All of them should give you access to almost any NPM module. 
  - jsDeliver also allows you to hotlink files from GitHub repositories ‚Äì just make sure to link the ESM version
  - [JSPM](https://generator.jspm.io) has a convenient import map generator that's worth a try
  - Also works with CSS!

- **Type checking:** `// @ts-check` in combination with JSDoc comments can do basic type checking. To learn more: [TypeScript, Minus TypeScript on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/typescript-minus-typescript/)

- **Deployment:** No `node_modules` or build process means you can literally just drop your project folder on any static file server that has an IP, and your app is ready. [Netlify Drop](http://app.netlify.com/drop) is probably the easiest.

### A note on Vue templates

Unbuild's Vue project template is set up to use render functions together with `htm` for a JSX-like syntax. Because of this we don't need to ship the Vue template compiler, which significantly reduces the amount of JavaScript we're loading. The downside is, of course, that you're limited to render functions instead of Vue templates.

If you prefer templates, replace the `vue` entry in the import map in `index.html` with a build that includes the template compiler. To learn more, see: [Which dist file to use?](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use)
